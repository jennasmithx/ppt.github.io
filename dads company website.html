	Complete Web Application Testing Guide: Learn How To Test A Website
	
	We all have to agree that in today’s ever-changing and competitive world, the internet has become an integral part of our lives.
	
	Most of us make our decisions by searching the information on the internet these days, hence hosting a website is no longer optional but mandatory for all kinds of businesses. This is the first step in becoming and staying relevant in the market.
	
	Just having a website is not enough. An organization is needed to develop a website that is informative, accessible, and user-friendly. To maintain all these qualities, the website should be well tested, and this process of testing a website is known as web testing.

	What is Web Testing?
	
	Web testing is a software testing practice to test websites or web applications to find potential bugs before making them live.
	
	A web-based system needs to be checked completely from end to end before it goes live for end users.
	
	By performing website testing, an organization can make sure that the web-based system is functioning properly and can be accepted by real-time users.
	
	UI design and functionality are the captains of website testing.

	Web Testing Checklists – How To Test A Website
	Functionality Testing
	Usability testing
	Interface testing
	Compatibility testing
	Performance testing
	Security testing

	Functionality Testing
	Test for – all the links in web pages, database connections, forms used for submitting or getting information from the user in the web pages, Cookie testing, etc.
	
	Check out all the links:
	
	Test the outgoing links from all the pages to the specific domain under test.
	Test all internal links.
	Test links jumping on the same page.
	Test links are used to send emails to admin or other users from web pages.
	Test to see if there are any orphan pages.
	Finally, link checking includes checking for broken links in all the above-mentioned links.
	Test forms on all pages: Forms are an integral part of any website. Forms are used to receive information from users and interact with them. So what should be checked in these forms?
	</p>

	<h1>Etc</h1>
	<p>
	First, check all the validations in each field.
	Check for default values in the fields.
	Wrong inputs in the forms to the fields in the forms.
	Options to create forms, if any, form deletes a view or modify the forms.

	

	Let’s take an example of the search engine project I am working on. For this project, we have advertisers and affiliate signup steps. Each sign-up step is different but it’s dependent on the other steps.
	
	So the signup flow should be executed correctly. There are different field validations like email Ids, User financial info validations, etc. All these validations should get checked for manual or automated web testing.
	
	Cookie Testing: Cookies are small files stored on the user’s machine. This is basically used to maintain the session – mainly the login sessions. Test the application by enabling or disabling the cookies in your browser options.
	
	Test if the cookies are encrypted before writing to the user machine. If you are testing session cookies (i.e. cookies that expire after the session ends) check for login sessions and user stats after the session ends. Check the effects on application security by deleting the cookies. (I will soon write a separate article on cookie testing as well)
